            Johnathan Martinez Pena is a third-year student at San Francisco State University, 
            majoring in Visual Communication Design and minoring in Civil Engineering. 
            While at San Francisco State University, he made a lot of connections and has had a great time getting to 
            know new people, overall has had a great experience so far. His passion for web design has driven him to take a web design 
            class to expand his knowledge of coding and website development. He is drawn to brand design, architecture, and interior design, 
            and he would like to pursue careers in these fields in the future. This may be due to the significant influence of 
            videos during his childhood, which has shaped his interests greatly. Minecraft, in particular, played a significant 
            role in his childhood as it was something that he enjoyed playing a lot, and has also helped bring out his creative side.

            In his spare time, he enjoys outdoor activities with friends, such as playing basketball at a nearby park, 
            visiting the theaters/cinema, and exploring new locations within the city. There are times in when he also 
            goes outside of the city and goes to explore other cities with friends to enjoy time together, and travels to other 
            states with family for vacation. Additionally, they have also developed an interest in exploring diverse cuisines with friends, such as 
            Italian, Indian, Korean, Japanese, Mexican, Chinese, and more. And have recently involved themselves in photography, as it was 
            something that a close friend had inspired him to do, which he found a great interest in. In moments of relaxation, 
            they enjoy online gaming, immersing themselves in manga/manhwa, and watching Korean and Chinese dramas. 
            These activities help their personal growth and offer a well-rounded balance to their academic goals.
