         <img src="img/Japan.avif" width="50%" Height="50%" alt="Red Building, Pink forest, and Mountain">
         <p>I put Japan at number 1 because I've always wanted to go there
            ever since I was a young child and sometime next year I might finally make this dream come true. And, I thought 
            that it would be a very nice place to go to with some friends for the first time to explore the nice cuisines. Some locations 
            in Japan that I'd like to visit would be Mount Fuji, Osaka, Kyoto, Tokyo, 
            Shibuya, Hokkaido, Fushimi Inari Taisha, Fukuoka, Toyko tower, and the Arashiyama Bamboo Forest.

            Jeju Island, Busan, Starfield Library, Changgyeonggung Palace, Gyeongju, Incheon, and I want to just have a nice
         experience there with some friends. </p>

         <img src="img/France.jpeg" width="50%" Height="50%" alt="Eiffel Tower, Sunset sky with clouds, and Trees in a park">
         <p>I chose France, as I'd like to visit Paris, and the Eiffel Tower, Arc de Triomphe, Verdon Gorge and other touristic locations
            there in France, but most importantly I want to also try french cuisine.

         <br>
         <img src="img/United Kingdom.jpg" width="50%" Height="50%" alt="United Kingdom Flag, Body of water, A bridge, and Clocktower building">
         <p>The United Kingdom is a place that I'd like to visit as I've seen a lot of old archictecture
            from the UK, that I would love to see in person such as the Cathedrals, the Castles, the famous Fracis Scott Key Bridge
            that sadly got removed earlier this year, and the Tower Bridge.

         <p>For China, theres a few places that I have in mind such as the stairway 
            to heaven which is also known as <q>Tianmen Mountain</q>, a few others would be to go to 
            Hong Kong, the Dragons's Back, Guangdong, Beijing, Shanghai, and Chengdu since some friends told me 
            great things about those locations.

         <img src="img/burgers.jpg" alt="Three burgers, a lot of tomatoes, lettuce, and on a piece of wood">
         <p>Burgers are one of my favorites because I love how there's many fast food locations 
            that sell them, and it's a food that we see quite a lot too. And one my favorite burger location's has to be

      <h3>Top 5 of my Favorite Animals</h3>
      <dl>
         <dt><strong>Panda</strong></dt>
         <br>
         <a href="https://www.americanhumane.org/blog/national-panda-day/">

            <img src="img/Panda.png" alt="Panda hugging a branch of a tree">
         </a>
         <dd>- Chubby, likes to sleep, eats bamboo and adorable</dd>
         <p>I decided to choose this as one of my animals, as I've always loved Panda's growing up
            and thought it was a really cute animal. Not only that, but I also have a panda plushie that was given to me 
            and I always found that it made me feel much happier, so panda's are the animal's that bring me joy and are my favorite
            because of that.
         </p>
         
         <dt><strong>Rabbit</strong></dt>

         <a href="https://www.caldervets.co.uk/pet-help-advice/rabbits/rabbit-dietary-advice/67-dental-care-for-rabbits">

            <img src="img/Rabbit.avif" alt="Rabbit with ears down, on grass, and eating a carrot">
         </a>
       
         <dd>- White, fluffy, jumps a lot and eat carrots</dd>
         <p>When I was a kid I always wanted to have a pet bunny/rabbit, but I was never able to have one
            because my parents would say that it was a pet that <q>smelled</q> a lot. Besides not being able to
            have one as a pet, I thought bunnies were really adorable by the way they acted and moved around in their day.
         </p>

         <dt><strong>Cheetah</strong></dt>
         <br>
         <a href="https://cheetah.org/canada/2020/06/22/for-cheetahs-speed-is-important-but-so-is-eyesight/">

            <img src="img/Cheetah.jpg" alt="Cheetah in grass field looking around, and bushes around the cheetah">
         </a>
         <dd>- Fast, lots of spots, and is a rare animal</dd>
         <p>As I choose this animal I remembered the times in grade-school when we first learned 
            about cheetah's and I thought they were really cool since they would run really fast, and it would be one of the quickest animals in the world.
            And I simply found that amazing to learn about, since I would love to run that quickly myself.
         </p>

         <dt><strong>Flamingo</strong></dt>
         <br>
         <a href="https://kids.nationalgeographic.com/animals/birds/facts/flamingo">

            <img src="img/flamingo.avif"  alt="A flamingo sleeping on one leg, in the water, with rocks in the background">
         </a>
         <dd>- Pink, stand on one leg, can fly, sleep standing up, and smell</dd>
         <p>For this animal I would that it is one of my favorites because it's one of the most memorable
            animals whenever I would go on field-trips to the zoo's with my family or from grade-school. And they are also
            really interesting creatures since they have very tiny legs and are able to maintain their balance super well.
         </p>

         <dt><strong>Penguin</strong></dt>
         <br>
         <a href="https://www.cabq.gov/artsculture/biopark/news/10-cool-facts-about-penguins">

            <img src="img/penguin.jpeg" alt="Tiny penguin sitting down, looks curious, and in the snow">
         </a>
         <dd>- Slide on stomach, live in the cold, waddle, and eat fish</dd>
         <p>The penguin is one of my favorite animals because I loved watching the movie <em>Happy Feet</em>. 
            And I always found penguins to be such cute animals, that live in big families in the cold and I also like
            how they waddle around.
