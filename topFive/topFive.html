         <p>For sushi, there's different types of sushi rolls, and I've always liked to try different
            kinds of Sushi rolls with my friends, and it's also a really nice meal to have.

      <div class="food">
      
         <br>
         <p>Burgers are one of my favorites because I love how there's many fast food locations 
            that sell them, and it's a food that we see quite a lot too. And one my favorite burger location's has to be
            In N Out, since they make their burgers really good.
         </p>

            serve Dim sum, and because of it I also began to love it a lot, not only that, but I also ate it a lot as I grew up.

      <h3>Top 5 of my Favorite Animals</h3>
      <dl>
         <dt><strong>Panda</strong></dt>
         <br>
         <a href="https://www.americanhumane.org/blog/national-panda-day/">

            <img src="img/Panda.png" alt="Panda hugging a branch of a tree">
         </a>
         <dd>- Chubby, likes to sleep, eats bamboo and adorable</dd>
         <p>I decided to choose this as one of my animals, as I've always loved Panda's growing up
            and thought it was a really cute animal. Not only that, but I also have a panda plushie that was given to me 
            and I always found that it made me feel much happier, so panda's are the animal's that bring me joy and are my favorite
            because of that.
         </p>
         
         <dt><strong>Rabbit</strong></dt>

         <a href="https://www.caldervets.co.uk/pet-help-advice/rabbits/rabbit-dietary-advice/67-dental-care-for-rabbits">

            <img src="img/Rabbit.avif" alt="Rabbit with ears down, on grass, and eating a carrot">
         </a>
       
         <dd>- White, fluffy, jumps a lot and eat carrots</dd>
         <p>When I was a kid I always wanted to have a pet bunny/rabbit, but I was never able to have one
            because my parents would say that it was a pet that <q>smelled</q> a lot. Besides not being able to
            have one as a pet, I thought bunnies were really adorable by the way they acted and moved around in their day.
         </p>

         <dt><strong>Cheetah</strong></dt>
         <br>
         <a href="https://cheetah.org/canada/2020/06/22/for-cheetahs-speed-is-important-but-so-is-eyesight/">

            <img src="img/Cheetah.jpg" alt="Cheetah in grass field looking around, and bushes around the cheetah">
         </a>
         <dd>- Fast, lots of spots, and is a rare animal</dd>
         <p>As I choose this animal I remembered the times in grade-school when we first learned 
            about cheetah's and I thought they were really cool since they would run really fast, and it would be one of the quickest animals in the world.
            And I simply found that amazing to learn about, since I would love to run that quickly myself.
         </p>

         <dt><strong>Flamingo</strong></dt>
         <br>
         <a href="https://kids.nationalgeographic.com/animals/birds/facts/flamingo">

            <img src="img/flamingo.avif"  alt="A flamingo sleeping on one leg, in the water, with rocks in the background">
         </a>
         <dd>- Pink, stand on one leg, can fly, sleep standing up, and smell</dd>
         <p>For this animal I would that it is one of my favorites because it's one of the most memorable
            animals whenever I would go on field-trips to the zoo's with my family or from grade-school. And they are also
            really interesting creatures since they have very tiny legs and are able to maintain their balance super well.
         </p>

         <dt><strong>Penguin</strong></dt>
         <br>
         <a href="https://www.cabq.gov/artsculture/biopark/news/10-cool-facts-about-penguins">

            <img src="img/penguin.jpeg" alt="Tiny penguin sitting down, looks curious, and in the snow">
         </a>
         <dd>- Slide on stomach, live in the cold, waddle, and eat fish</dd>
         <p>The penguin is one of my favorite animals because I loved watching the movie <em>Happy Feet</em>. 
            And I always found penguins to be such cute animals, that live in big families in the cold and I also like
            how they waddle around.
